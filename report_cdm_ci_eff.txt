- SUMMARY -
The initial version of the CDM code is complex and slow.
A possible improvement in speed and semplification can be achieved by treating the Charge Injection using effective densities, initialised before the X-ray events processing.
Here I set up a project/repository/folder to develop a new version of the CDM with effective densities.

- GITHub repository -
Set up
https://github.com/claudioPaga/CDM_ci_eff
Initialise the repository in current folder
/Users/cp232/SMILE/CDM_ci_eff

First push to repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/claudioPaga/CDM_ci_eff.git
git push -u origin main

Further updates of files
git commit -m "Update report file" report_cdm_ci_eff.txt
git status
git push

- SETUP FILES -
The setup files at different Temperatures must be updated to allow the setting of effective densities.
The effective densities are specific to the image/store/serial regions and are a function of position DETY in image/store and of DETY and DETX in the serial register.

Attempt at first version of updated setup file. Start with T=173K

        setup_cdm_variables_eol173.pro

Added the following pars:
trap_ci_eff_image_flag  -> True if density must be updated with effective value because of CI
trap_ci_eff_image_fixed -> True if updated value is expressed as a single value v. DETY
trap_ci_eff_image_fraction -> Effective density fraction, if it can be expressed as a single value v. DETY
trap_ci_eff_image_function -> True if effective density must be expressed as an expo function of DETY.
                              In this case, the expo parameters must be read in from a look-up table.
NOTE: the above also have versions for store and serial register
trap_ci_eff_serial_detx -> True if effective density has a DETX dependence in the serial register

For now, setup file has been updated for T=173.
Once this has been tested succesfully other temperatures will be updated.

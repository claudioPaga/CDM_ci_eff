- SUMMARY -
The initial version of the CDM code is complex and slow.
A possible improvement in speed and semplification can be achieved by treating the Charge Injection using effective densities, initialised before the X-ray events processing.
Here I set up a project/repository/folder to develop a new version of the CDM with effective densities.

- GITHub repository -
Set up

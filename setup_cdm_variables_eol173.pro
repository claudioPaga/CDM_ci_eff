;;; History -
;;; 24 May 2021 - Trap species upped to 4. Trap parameters updated to
;;;               values provided by Tom Buggey (21/05/2021)
;;;               To better match results and future applications the
;;;               trap parameters are now expressed using physical
;;;               units instead of the convenient units such as
;;;               readout time.
;;;               Readout times units are now seconds instead of units
;;;               of readout periods.
;;;               Added additional parameters used for internal
;;;               transformation of units
;;;               According to Tom the same trap species should be
;;;               present in image/store/serial readout.
;;;
;;; 15 June 2021 - Trap densities from Tom are relative to entire pixel.               
;;;                I want to scale the density to the value measured
;;;                from trap-pumping test at the OU, that reveals a
;;;                turn-up at around ~20K e-, supposedly the edge of
;;;                the SBC. At that flux the density is of approx
;;;                0.005 traps/pixel (see plot density.png)
;;;                Normalise Tom's densities to that value, as
;;;                my code implicitly only accounts for traps in the
;;;                SBC
;;;
;;; 17 Nov 2021 - Set temperature to T=-100C (173K) to test possible
;;;               warmer regimes.  
;;;
;;; 11 March 2022 - Re-evaluated the trap_density_sbc factor.
;;;                 During meeting with OU David noted that the trap
;;;                 density values were relative to the signal flux
;;;                 used in the test, not to the entire pixel. The
;;;                 signal during the test is 10k ele (Tom email, 10
;;;                 March 2022). Therefore, the scaling to the SBC is
;;;                 actually (20k/10k)^(1-charge_volume_coeff)~1.125
;;;                 and not 0.25 (the fraction of traps in a pixel in
;;;                 the SBC).
;;;
;;; 13 September 2022 - Add flags and effective densities to model the effect of CI in updated CDM treatment
